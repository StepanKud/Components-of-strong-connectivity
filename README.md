# Components-of-strong-connectivity
In this reposition, I will tell you how to find components of strong connectivity in a directed graph, for shortening we will say csc, csc is a set of vertices where there is strong connectivity between any two vertices (from any one you can get to all other vertices)
Csc is an important topic because thanks to it 1)you can find out if there is a path from a to b and from b to a 2) to create a condensation graph
